## Overview of the Week:
- This week, I focused on enhancing my JavaScript skills through freeCodeCamp and LeetCode exercises. I completed various projects and modules, gaining hands-on experience in JavaScript algorithms, 
  data structures, DOM manipulation, and string and array methods. Additionally, I worked with my team lead to draft a proposal for Xotic Customs, covering online presence assessment and domain checkup.

## What I Learned This Week:
- Throughout the week, I deepened my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and applied them to practical projects in freeCodeCamp. I also explored form validation and DOM manipulation techniques. 
  Working on the proposal for Xotic Customs provided insights into assessing online presence and creating professional proposals.

## Technologies Learned:
- JavaScript (algorithms, data structures, DOM manipulation, string and array methods)
- FreeCodeCamp projects (Pyramid Generator, Gradebook App, Role Playing Game, Calorie Counter, Rock Paper Scissors Game, Music Player)
- LeetCode (beginner problems)
- Proposal creation using Google Docs and Canva

## Challenges Faced:
- Solving LeetCode problems efficiently.
- Stuck on a code to build a palindrome checker.

## How I Overcame Challenges:
- Referred to online resources and tutorials.
- Still working on the Palindrome checher. 

## Goals for Next Week:
- Continue advancing my JavaScript skills and tackle more challenging problems on LeetCode.
- Explore more advanced topics in JavaScript and related web development technologies.
- Begin working on a new project to apply and integrate my learning.
- Improve proposal writing skills.
- Deepen my understanding of SEO techniques and their practical applications.

## Questions/Notes:
