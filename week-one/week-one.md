# Weekly Log - Week 2024-27

## Overview of the Week
- I started learning WordPress on May 19, and by the end of the week, I published an official webpage, which is my first ever project done outside of university and in the real world. I became familiar with WordPress within a week, initially starting with a dummy website using plugins and elements. By the end of the week, I learned about a premium theme and improved my content writing using ChatGPT. Throughout this week, I also improved my communication skills better than before.

## What I Learned This Week 
- From May 19 to May 21: I learned about WordPress, what a plugin is and I learned some basic SEO tips to help my site show up better in search engines and ways to make my site load faster. Later became familiar with almost everything, including plugins and using Elementor. I was tasked with building a website from scratch with sections like Home, About Us, Blog, Portfolio, and Contact Us. I referred to YouTube videos to learn how to use the Elementor plugin and other plugins, which greatly helped me navigate WordPress easily.Discovered how to search for, install, and activate plugins to extend the functionality of the site. Practiced creating and publishing blog posts and portfolio pages.Learned to use elementor to add and customize various types of content blocks, such as text, images, galleries, grid posts and maps. Experimented with custom CSS to make style changes that go beyond theme options by referring the Youtube video.

- On May 21: I also learned about the process of making a project proposal. Conducted a thorough assessment to understand the requirements, which involved:
    - Performing a current online presence assessment.
    - Checking the domain - I learned how to verify existing domains that are already taken and understood the importance of a domain. - Used domains.lk for this purpose.
    - Learned how to check hosting and evaluate the hosting provider.
    - Verifying the SSL certificate.
    - Evaluating the content based on the client's already available website.
    - Learned how to create a pricing and service charge structure within a timeline for the end product.

- From May 22 to May 26, I learned many useful things. I discovered how to choose and customize themes to make the site look great. I also found out how to install and set up plugins to add new features. Editing and creating pages became easier as I practiced on a dummy website. First, I chose an appropriate theme from the array of available themes, then installed it using the website installer and explored the theme options to change the site identity, colors, menus, widgets, and page settings. I changed the required fields, such as adding the logo, contact details of the company, and other general settings in theme options. I also noted that I should not touch the Hero and Typography sections in theme options.

After making the basic changes, I started to add content and disabled some of the elements to keep the webpage with the required amount of details. I learned how to link each menu item to redirect to specific pages and how to get relevant details about the company from the client by asking a few key questions that cover everything necessary to build the content of the webpage. I built good communication with the team leader, and whenever I finished a task, I made sure to let them know.

I learned about content blocks and how to edit the footer in general. I learned how to edit pages and manipulate each section and its settings, as well as how to change the placement and colors where required. I also learned about adding blog posts, creating an account for an author, and how to change and edit posts. Additionally, I learned about permalinks and manipulating the content of the page. Finally, after thoroughly testing the webpage by checking if each link worked and if the content was in place, and with the team leader's approval, we turned off maintenance mode and published the webpage at the end of the day, satisfied with how it looked.
