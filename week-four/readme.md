# Weekly Log - Week 2024-07
# Hours worked: 59hrs 01mins

## Overview of the Week:
- This week was focused on refreshing my Python skills, developing a password generator extension, creating social media content, and exploring UI/UX design tools. 
  I also delved into Git workflow concepts and CI/DevOps practices. The experience was diverse, enhancing my technical and design skills while collaborating with my team lead.

## What I Learned This Week:
- Throughout the week, I revisited Python basics, specifically classes, objects, and API integration. 
  I developed a password generator extension from scratch, focusing on HTML, JavaScript, and UI design using TeleportHQ and Figma. 
  Additionally, I created a social media post using Canva, explored importing designs from Figma to Webflow, and learned about Git Flow vs. GitHub Flow.

## Technologies Learned:
- Python programming (classes, objects, libraries, and API integration)
- HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for Chrome extension development
- UI design with TeleportHQ and Figma
- Social media content creation with Canva and OpenArt.AI
- Intro to Git workflow concepts (Git Flow vs. GitHub Flow)
- CI and DevOps intro

## Challenges Faced:
- Debugging the import process from Figma to TeleportHQ.
- Ensuring the password generator extension's UI matched the design specifications and the connection with python.
- Refreshing and applying Python skills after a break.

## How I Overcame Challenges:
- Collaborated with my team lead and utilized online tutorials to troubleshoot the Figma to TeleportHQ import process.
- Iterated on the UI design using VS Code for better integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Revisited Python tutorials and documentation, and practiced coding exercises to reinforce my understanding.

## Goals for Next Week:
- Deepen my understanding of advanced WordPress development.
- Continue exploring advanced Git features.
- Learn more about SEO techniques and their practical applications.
- Begin working on a new project to apply my skills.
- Improve my design skills with Figma and other tools.
- Explore new tools and aim to build a small software project.
- Work on a new project using Python.

## Questions/Notes:
- How can I improve my understanding and implementation of object-oriented programming concepts in Python?
- What are some best practices for connecting and working with APIs in Python?
- How can I integrate Python with other technologies and platforms I am working with, such as WordPress or server setups?
- Seeking feedback on recently published content to identify areas for improvement.

## Additional Comments:
This week has been a valuable learning experience. I appreciate the guidance from my team lead and the opportunity to work on diverse tasks, which has significantly enhanced my technical skills. 
Moving forward, I aim to continue building on this foundation and tackle more complex projects to broaden my knowledge.
