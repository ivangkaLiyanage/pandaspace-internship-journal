# Weekly Log - Week 2024-06

## Overview of the Week
- This week I learned so many new concepts. I learned about Git, mastering some basic commands and branching techniques. I researched Jira's functionalities. 
  I set up local WP and created some websites from my local machine also i got to know how an account is created in wordpress which was a question for me in week one. 
  I also learned about the differences between LAMP and LEMP stacks other than that i also found out some other server stacks. Additionally, I explored SSH, AWS, 
  and the basics of Linux servers, including setting up and securing a LAMP stack on Ubuntu. 

## What I Learned This Week
- This week was highly educational. I started by learning Git and its branching concepts, which I practiced through a Git branching game. I resarched about Jira and Local WP 
  which gave me a foundation about local WordPress development. I also created three blog posts for queens.lk. Midweek, I learned about LAMP and LEMP stacks, compared Apache 
  and Nginx, and built a local LAMP server. I downloaded the YOAST plugin, formulated client questions, and also got a glimpse of an idea on how to create a small eCommerce 
  website with WooCommerce plugin using wordPress. Additionally, I searched a bit on SEO and edited some of the SEO part in the webpage. I also completed multiple stages of the Git branching game.

  Towards the end of the week, I learned about server technologies and cloud computing. I set up accounts on Webhost, AWS, Oracle and Figma, and learned about SSH key pairs and Linux distributions. 
  I learned how to create an EC2 instance using AWS. I installed a secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu and set up WordPress. I also researched about prompt engineering and how to submit a website to search engines. 
  I also tried to set up LEMP stack on ubuntu by myself but unfortunately i was not able to complete it as i was stuck with an error. Overall, this week was a blend of both theoretical learning 
  with practical application.

## Technologies Learned
 - Git and Git branching
 - Jira 
 - Local WP for WordPress development
 - LAMP and LEMP stacks
 - Apache vs Nginx
 - SSH key pair generation
 - AWS 
 - Oracle server setup
 - Figma for design

## Challenges Faced
 - One of the main challenges I faced was understanding and setting up different server environments, particulary i found it a bit challenging while i was setting up LAMP 
   and i found some difficulties at some places. At first I didn't fully understand everything entirely but later i got the hang of it. I tried to set up LEMP by myself but i was not successful 

## How I Overcame Challenges
 - To overcome the challenges with setting up server environments, I asked multiple questions from my team lead. 
   For the LEMP setup, I seeked assistance from the team lead for a better understanding. Even though I didn't fully complete the LEMP setup, i now know where i went wrong.

## Goals for Next Week
 - Continue refining my understanding of WordPress development.
 - Learn more about advanced Git features.
 - Deepen my knowledge of server management, particularly focusing on AWS.
 - Explore more about SEO techniques and how to implement them effectively.
 - Start working on a new project using the skills I have acquired.
 - Enhance my design skills using Figma.
 - Further learn more tools and hopefully build a software as well.

## Questions/Notes
 - How can I better troubleshoot and resolve errors when setting up server environments like LEMP?
 - Seeking feedback on recently published content to identify areas for improvement.

## Additional Comments
 - This week has been a significant learning experience. The hands-on work with server setups and WordPress development has been rewarding. 
   I appreciate the support from my team lead and am eager to apply what I've learned to more complex projects. 
   Moving forward, I aim to deepen my technical skills and explore new tools to broaden my knowledge.
